# strokes
we can take advantage of the hexagonal keys of a tif keyboard to type by strokes.

the pinkie, ring, and middle fingers must press a key on the same column as their home key, and a key adjacent to the keys pressed by the fingers next to them. any finger is allowed to not press a key, except for the ring finger in the case where both the pinkie and middle fingers press a key. the index finger is free to press any key either on its home column or the column to the right of that, in all cases. a stroke goes from the pinkie to the index finger.

that is my definition of a stroke on a tif. we optimise for a keymap with the highest frequency of strokes. of course, you're not guaranteed a key stroke when typing.
